  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p style="font-style: italic;">"Setup.rb is the generic installer for ruby scripts and extentions.
  You can automate configuration and installation of your program package
  very easily with setup.rb simply by following a convention. And if
  you need more control, setup.rb also offers all the configuration you'll 
  ever need."</p>

  <p>Every well practiced Rubyist is aware of Minero Aoki's ever present <b>setup.rb</b>
  script. It's how most of us installed Ruby programs before RubyGems
  came along. And it's still mighty useful in certain scenarios, not the
  least of which is the job of the distro package maintainer.</p>

  <p>Ruby Setup is a conversion of setup.rb into a stand-alone application. No longer
  requiring the distribution of the setup.rb script with every Ruby package.<sup>*</sup>
  Just instruct one's users to install  Ruby Setup (<code>gem install setup</code>) and go from there.
  As long as a project is <i>setup.rb compliant</i>, as most are, then there is little
  to nothing the developer must do.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 80%;"><sup>*</sup>Of course, if you prefer, you can still distribute
  a bundled version the new setup.rb along with your package.</p>

  <h2>How to Use</h2>

  <p>Typical end-installer usage looks like this:</p>

  <pre>
    $ tar -xvzf helloworld-1.0.0.tgz
    $ cd helloworld-1.0.0.tgz
    $ sudo setup.rb
  </pre>

  <p>If need be, the end-installer can separate setup.rb's operations
  into it's component phases:</p>

  <pre>
    $ setup.rb config
    $ setup.rb make
    $ sudo setup.rb install
  </pre>

  <p>This is also the same as running <tt>setup.rb all</tt>.</p>


  <h3>Configuration</h2>

  <p>Setup.rb provides numerous configuration options:</p>

  <pre>
       --prefix                   path prefix of target environment
       --bindir                   directory for commands
       --libdir                   directory for libraries
       --datadir                  directory for shared data
       --mandir                   directory for man pages
       --docdir                   Directory for documentation
       --sysconfdir               directory for system configuration files
       --localstatedir            directory for local state data
       --libruby                  directory for ruby libraries
       --librubyver               directory for standard ruby libraries
       --librubyverarch           directory for standard ruby extensions
       --siteruby                 directory for version-independent aux ruby libraries
       --siterubyver              directory for aux ruby libraries
       --siterubyverarch          directory for aux ruby binaries
       --rbdir                    directory for ruby scripts
       --sodir                    directory for ruby extentions
       --rubypath                 path to set to #! line
       --rubyprog                 ruby program used for installation
       --makeprog                 make program to compile ruby extentions
       --extconfopt               options to pass-thru to extconf.rb
       --shebang                  shebang line (#!) editing mode (all,ruby,never)
       --[no-]ext                 do or do not compile/install ruby extentions
       --[no-]test                do or do not run tests
       --[no-]doc                 do or do not install documentation (doc/)
       --[no-]ri                  do or do not generate ri documentation
       --root                     set the installation root prefix
       --install-prefix           old term for --root
       --type                     install location mode (std,site,home)
       --installdirs              old term for --type
  </pre>

  <p>The most significant to the end-user are <tt>--type</tt> and <tt>--root</tt>, which direct the
  overall installation locations.</p>

  <p>You can see the configuration, using +show+.</p>

  <pre>
    $ setup.rb show
  </pre>


  <h3>Compiling</h3>

  <pre>
    $ setup.rb make
  </pre>

  <p>Compiling extensions is handled via 'make'.
  This looks in the <tt>ext/</tt> directory for all <tt>Makefile</tt>s.
  Which are then executed to compile the extensions.</p>

  <!--
  <p>You can also pass targets to make.</p>

  <pre>
    $ setup.rb make clean
  <pre>

  <pre>
    $ setup.rb make distclean
  <pre>
  -->

  <h3>Testing</h3>

  <pre>
    $ setup.rb test
  </pre>

  <p>Because there is now a deverse selection of testing tools available for Ruby,
  testing only works if the developer has provided a test runner command script,
  <tt>.setup/testrc.rb</tt>. This ensures that tests run according the developers
  intensions. Note, you can activate testing when using <tt>.setup.rb all</tt>
  via the <tt>--test</tt> or </tt>-t</tt> option.</p>

  <pre>
    $ setup.rb all -t
  </pre>

  <p>Keep in mind that testing may require support extra libraries such as RSpec,
  FlexMock, Lemon, Bacon, QED, Cucumber, etc.</p>


  <h3>Installing</h3>

  <pre>
    $ setup.rb install
  </pre>

  <p>The installation proccess moves through each conventional file type (bin, 
  ext, lib, doc, man, etc) and installs the files to the configured locations
  in the file system.</p>

  <p>To install <tt>doc</tt> directory files, setup.rb must know the name of the
  project. It will look for this in <tt>.setup/name</tt>, <tt>meta/name</tt> and
  <tt>.meta/name</tt>, whichever comes first. The doc files are then installed
  the appropriate documentation directory in a subdirectory called
  <tt>ruby-[name]</tt>. If the name of the project cannot be determined,
  setup.rb will not install <tt>doc/</tt> files.</p>


  <h3>Documenting</h3>

  <pre>
    $ setup.rb document
  </pre>

  <p>Documenting generates <tt>ri</tt> documents for the program and automatically
  places them in the appropriate system location. Documenting is not
  part of the standard sequence due to the way ri documentation is currently
  handled by the <tt>rdoc</tt> tool -- it is not possible to uninstall them. So this
  phase must be run separate from the others. Please only use the +document+
  command when you know you for sure you want the documentation in your ri
  system.</p>


  <h3>Uninstalling</h3>

  <pre>
    $ setup.rb uninstall
  </pre>

  <p>Uninstalling is made possible by the 'InstalledFiles' file that is
  generated by the install process. If that file is deleted than you
  will not be able to uninstall. (You can get around this be reinstalling
  first though).</p>


  <h2>Development</h2>

  <p>Ruby Setup is a ProUtils project. It is hosted on GitHub at
  <a href="http://github.com/proutils/setup">http://github.com/proutils/setup</a>.</p>

  <p>If you find this project useful please consider contributing to it's
  development. Given the nature of this application, it is important that it's
  implementation is rock solid. That means, the more people working with it
  the better.</p>
