= RELEASE NEWS

Currently Setup doesn not support Aoki's Metaconfig API.
It's usefulness seems extremely limited, but we will 
reconsider adding it back in a furture version.

This is an early release of Setup. While it is likely
to work just fine, at this point we are not recommending
it for production use.
