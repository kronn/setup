== 4.1.0 // 2008-09-06

Change the location of the cache files to .cache/setup/.


== 4.0.0 // 2008-08-16

This is the initial release of Setup. As such it is
getting the label "betaware" until enough people put
it through it's paces. However, since it is predominantly
setup.rb 3.4.1 code, and that it works to install 
itself ;) it certainly is a usable product.

Please report any problems so we can fix them ASAP.

Currently Setup does not support Aoki's Metaconfig API.
It's usefulness seems limited to me, but we can 
reconsider adding it back in a furture version.

Multi-package support has also been removed.
