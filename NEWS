== 4.0.0 // 2008-08-16

This is the initial release of Setup. As such it is getting
the label "betaware" until enough people put it 
through it's paces. However, since it is predominantly
setup.rb 3.4.1 code, and that it works to install
itself ;) it certainly is a usable product.

Please report any problems so we can fix them ASAP.

Currently Setup does not support Aoki's Metaconfig API.
It's usefulness seems extremely limited, but we will 
reconsider adding it back in a furture version.

Multi-package support has also been removed.
