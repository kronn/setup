= Setup

Every Rubyist is aware of Minero Aoki's ever useful
setup.rb script. It's how most of us used to install
our ruby programs before RubyGems came along.And it's
still mighty useful in certain scenarios, not the least
of which is the job of the distribution package managers.
Setup converts setup.rb into a stand-alone application.
No longer will you need distribute setup.rb with you
Ruby packages. Just instruct your users to use Setup.


== Install

The easy way to install is via RubyGems.

  $ gem install setup

To install Setup manually you need to "boot-strap" it.
This is done for you, by running the following:

  $ script/install


== Usage

As long as a ruby project conforms to the standard project
layout, usage is as simple as:

  $ ruby-setup config
  $ ruby-setup setup
  $ ruby-setup install

If you later decide you want to remove the program.

  $ ruby-setup uninstall

Note that uninstall is made possible by the .installedfiles
file that is generated by the install process. If that file
is deleted than you will not be able to uninstall. (You can
get around this be reinstalling first though).

You can clean up any setup products with:

  $ ruby-setup clean

And restore the package to it's pristine state with:

  $ ruby-setup distclean

Not that this last command will remove the .installedfiles file!


== Todo

* Maybe protect .installedfiles from removal, even on distclean.
* Separate compiling code into separate class.
